# Task ID: 2
# Title: Move Component Files to src/components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate all component files from /components to /src/components while maintaining the same subdirectory structure.
# Details:
1. Use rsync or a similar tool to copy files while preserving directory structure:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --exclude="node_modules" --exclude=".git" components/ src/components/
   ```
2. Alternatively, use a script to move files while preserving structure:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs-extra');
   fs.copySync('components', 'src/components', {
     filter: (src) => !src.includes('node_modules') && !src.includes('.git')
   });
   ```
3. Verify all files have been copied correctly by comparing directory structures:
   ```bash
   find components -type f | sort > components_files.txt
   find src/components -type f | sort > src_components_files.txt
   diff components_files.txt src_components_files.txt
   ```
4. Do not delete the original files yet until all testing is complete.

# Test Strategy:
1. Compare file counts between original and new directories
2. Check that all subdirectories have been preserved
3. Verify a sample of files to ensure content integrity
4. Run a basic build to check for immediate errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze current component directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing component files in /components to understand the directory structure, organization patterns, and any special cases.
### Details:
Document the current directory hierarchy, component organization, naming conventions, and identify any potential issues or edge cases that might affect the migration. Create a complete inventory of all component files and their locations.

## 2. Create a migration plan document [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop a detailed plan outlining the migration strategy, including path mappings, import statement updates, and potential risks.
### Details:
Document how paths will change, how import statements will be updated, any special handling needed for specific components, and a rollback strategy in case of issues. Include a timeline and checkpoints for the migration process.

## 3. Create migration script [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Develop an automated script to handle the file movement and path updates in import statements.
### Details:
Write a script (bash, Node.js, or other appropriate language) that will automate the process of moving files from /components to /src/components while preserving the directory structure. Include logic to update import paths in all relevant files across the codebase.

## 4. Execute component migration [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Run the migration script to move component files while preserving directory structure.
### Details:
Execute the migration script in a controlled environment. Monitor the process for any errors or warnings. Ensure all files are moved correctly and directory structures are maintained. Document any manual interventions required during the process.

## 5. Verify file migration completeness [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Perform checks to ensure all files were moved correctly and no files were lost in the process.
### Details:
Compare file counts and checksums between the original and new locations. Verify that all components have been moved with their correct directory structure. Check that no files remain in the old location unless intentionally left there.

## 6. Update and test import statements [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Verify and fix any import statements throughout the codebase that reference the moved components.
### Details:
Run a codebase-wide search for import statements referencing the old component paths. Test that components can be imported correctly from their new locations. Update any build configurations or module resolution settings that might be affected by the path changes.

## 7. Validate application functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Run comprehensive tests to ensure the application works correctly with the moved components.
### Details:
Execute unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing to verify that the application functions correctly after the migration. Check for any runtime errors related to component imports. Verify that all component functionality works as expected in the application.
