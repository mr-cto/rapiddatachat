# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Schema Evolution Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to handle schema evolution as new columns are added from subsequent file uploads.
# Details:
Create functionality that:
- Identifies new columns in uploaded files
- Provides interface for adding these columns to the global schema
- Updates database structure to accommodate new columns
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- Handles data migration if needed

Implement versioning for schema changes to track evolution over time. Ensure performance considerations for schema updates on large datasets.

# Test Strategy:
Test identification of new columns in various file formats. Verify schema update process maintains data integrity. Test backward compatibility with existing queries. Performance test schema evolution with large datasets. Verify schema version history is maintained correctly.
