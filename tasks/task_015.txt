# Task ID: 15
# Title: Remove Legacy File Activation Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 10, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Remove the existing file activation steps from both frontend and backend to complete the simplified upload flow.
# Details:
Identify and remove:
- File activation API endpoints
- Frontend components related to file activation
- Database tables or columns specific to the activation process
- Any references to activation in the codebase

Ensure removal doesn't break existing functionality. Update documentation to reflect the simplified flow. Redirect any existing activation requests to the new flow if needed for backward compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify system functions correctly after removal of activation components. Test that existing data remains accessible. Ensure no references to activation remain in the user interface. Regression test all affected functionality.
