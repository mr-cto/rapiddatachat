# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Data Query and Access API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create API endpoints for querying and accessing the normalized data stored in the system.
# Details:
Implement API endpoints for:
- Retrieving normalized data with filtering and pagination
- Accessing schema information
- Querying data across multiple uploads
- Exporting data in various formats

Optimize query performance with appropriate indexing and query optimization. Implement security measures to control data access. Support complex queries across the normalized data structure.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test API endpoints for correct data retrieval. Performance test with large datasets. Security test for access control. Verify query results match expected data. Test pagination and filtering functionality.
