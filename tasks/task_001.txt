# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Project Backup and Target Directories
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a complete backup of the project and set up the target directories for the restructuring process.
# Details:
1. Create a Git branch for the restructuring to serve as a backup and allow for easy rollback if needed
2. Create the target directories (src/components and src/lib) for the restructured project
3. Document all current import patterns to ensure we don't miss any during the migration
4. Create a mapping document to track the migration progress

# Test Strategy:
Verify that:
1. The backup branch has been created successfully
2. The target directories exist
3. The import pattern documentation is complete and accurate
4. The mapping document correctly lists all files to be migrated

# Subtasks:
## 1.1. Create Git branch for restructuring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git branch to serve as a backup and allow for easy rollback if needed.
### Details:
Run the following commands:
```bash
git checkout -b project-restructure
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before project restructuring"
```

## 1.2. Create target directories in src folder [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary target directories for the restructured project.
### Details:
Run the following command to create the directories if they don't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p src/components
mkdir -p src/lib
```

## 1.3. Document current import patterns from components directory [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Search the codebase for all imports from the components directory.
### Details:
Run the following command to find all component imports:
```bash
grep -r "from ['\"].*components" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
```
Save the output to a file for reference during migration.

## 1.4. Document current import patterns from lib directory [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Search the codebase for all imports from the lib directory.
### Details:
Run the following command to find all lib imports:
```bash
grep -r "from ['\"].*lib" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
```
Save the output to a file for reference during migration.

## 1.5. Create file mapping document for migration tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a document that maps all files that need to be moved to their new locations.
### Details:
Create a spreadsheet or markdown document that includes:
1. Original file path
2. New file path
3. Import pattern changes needed
4. Migration status (not started, in progress, completed)
5. Any notes or issues encountered
