# Task ID: 3
# Title: Move Library Files to src/lib
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate all library files from /lib to /src/lib while maintaining the same subdirectory structure.
# Details:
1. Use rsync or a similar tool to copy files while preserving directory structure:
   ```bash
   rsync -av --exclude="node_modules" --exclude=".git" lib/ src/lib/
   ```
2. Alternatively, use a script to move files while preserving structure:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs-extra');
   fs.copySync('lib', 'src/lib', {
     filter: (src) => !src.includes('node_modules') && !src.includes('.git')
   });
   ```
3. Verify all files have been copied correctly by comparing directory structures:
   ```bash
   find lib -type f | sort > lib_files.txt
   find src/lib -type f | sort > src_lib_files.txt
   diff lib_files.txt src_lib_files.txt
   ```
4. Do not delete the original files yet until all testing is complete.

# Test Strategy:
1. Compare file counts between original and new directories
2. Check that all subdirectories have been preserved
3. Verify a sample of files to ensure content integrity
4. Run a basic build to check for immediate errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze library directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the current /lib directory structure to understand file organization, dependencies, and import patterns.
### Details:
Create a detailed map of the current library structure including file counts, directory hierarchy, and identify any circular dependencies. Document import patterns used throughout the codebase that reference these libraries. Note any special cases like dynamically loaded modules.

## 2. Create migration script [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop an automated script to handle the migration of files from /lib to /src/lib.
### Details:
Write a script (bash, Python, or Node.js) that will handle the migration process. The script should create the target directory structure, copy files while preserving metadata, and update import paths in the codebase. Include logging and the ability to rollback changes if issues occur.

## 3. Move library files while preserving structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Execute the migration script to move all files from /lib to /src/lib while maintaining the directory structure.
### Details:
Run the migration script in a controlled environment. Monitor the process to ensure all files are moved correctly. Update any build configurations, package.json references, or other system configurations that might reference the old path. Document any manual interventions required during the process.

## 4. Verify file migration completeness [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Perform verification checks to ensure all files were moved correctly and no data was lost.
### Details:
Compare file counts, checksums, and directory structures between the original and new locations. Verify that all files have been moved with the correct permissions and attributes. Check for any orphaned files or directories that might have been missed during the migration process.

## 5. Test library imports and functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the moved libraries can be imported and function correctly.
### Details:
Create and run unit tests that import from the new location. Verify that all modules can be imported without errors. Test key functionality to ensure the libraries work as expected after the move. Run integration tests to verify that the application works end-to-end with the new library location.
