# Data Validation Framework

This document outlines the design of the data validation framework for the data upload flow. The framework is responsible for ensuring data quality and consistency throughout the transformation process.

## Overview

The data validation framework provides capabilities to:

1. Enforce data quality rules
2. Check for completeness, accuracy, and consistency
3. Support custom validation rules
4. Support schema validation
5. Support business rule validation
6. Implement validation reporting to track data quality metrics

## Validation Types

The framework supports various types of validation:

### 1. Schema Validation

Schema validation ensures that data conforms to a predefined schema, including:

- **Type Validation**: Ensures that data values match their expected types (e.g., string, number, boolean, date)
- **Format Validation**: Ensures that data values match specific formats (e.g., email, URL, phone number)
- **Range Validation**: Ensures that numeric values fall within specified ranges
- **Length Validation**: Ensures that string values have appropriate lengths
- **Pattern Validation**: Ensures that string values match specific patterns (regex)
- **Enumeration Validation**: Ensures that values are from a predefined set of allowed values

### 2. Relationship Validation

Relationship validation ensures that relationships between data entities are valid, including:

- **Referential Integrity**: Ensures that references to other entities exist
- **Cardinality**: Ensures that the number of related entities is within specified limits
- **Dependency**: Ensures that dependent entities are valid

### 3. Business Rule Validation

Business rule validation ensures that data conforms to specific business rules, including:

- **Conditional Validation**: Validates data based on conditions
- **Cross-Field Validation**: Validates data across multiple fields
- **Aggregate Validation**: Validates aggregated data
- **Temporal Validation**: Validates data based on time constraints
- **Domain-Specific Validation**: Validates data based on domain-specific rules

### 4. Data Quality Validation

Data quality validation ensures that data meets quality standards, including:

- **Completeness**: Ensures that required data is present
- **Accuracy**: Ensures that data is accurate
- **Consistency**: Ensures that data is consistent across the dataset
- **Uniqueness**: Ensures that data is unique where required
- **Timeliness**: Ensures that data is up-to-date
- **Reasonableness**: Ensures that data is reasonable and plausible

## Validation Rules

Validation rules are defined using a declarative approach, specifying:

1. Target entity and field
2. Validation type
3. Validation parameters
4. Error message
5. Severity level
6. Remediation action

Example validation rule:

```json
{
  "id": "rule_email_format",
  "entity": "User",
  "field": "email",
  "type": "format",
  "parameters": {
    "format": "email"
  },
  "message": "Invalid email format",
  "severity": "error",
  "remediation": "reject"
}
```

## Validation Process

The validation process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Rule Selection

Select validation rules applicable to the data being validated based on:

- Entity type
- Validation context
- User preferences

### 2. Rule Execution

Execute selected validation rules against the data, including:

- Schema validation
- Relationship validation
- Business rule validation
- Data quality validation

### 3. Result Aggregation

Aggregate validation results, including:

- Validation status
- Error messages
- Warning messages
- Metrics

### 4. Result Handling

Handle validation results based on severity and configuration:

- **Error**: Reject data or request correction
- **Warning**: Accept data with warnings
- **Info**: Accept data with informational messages

## Validation Reporting

The framework provides comprehensive validation reporting, including:

### 1. Validation Summary

Summary of validation results, including:

- Total records validated
- Records passed
- Records failed
- Records with warnings
- Validation metrics

### 2. Validation Details

Detailed validation results, including:

- Record-level validation status
- Field-level validation status
- Error messages
- Warning messages

### 3. Validation Metrics

Metrics for tracking data quality, including:

- Completeness rate
- Accuracy rate
- Consistency rate
- Error rate
- Warning rate

  rule_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  field TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  severity TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (rule_id) REFERENCES validation_rules(id)
)
```

### 3. Validation Runs

```sql
CREATE TABLE validation_runs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  entity TEXT NOT NULL,
  total_records INTEGER NOT NULL,
  passed_records INTEGER NOT NULL,

```javascript
const validationService = new ValidationService();

const data = [
  {
    id: "user_1",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    age: 30,
  },
  {
    id: "user_2",
    name: "Jane Smith",
    email: "invalid-email",
    age: 25,
  },
];

const validationResult = await validationService.validate("User", data);

console.log(`Validation status: ${validationResult.status}`);
console.log(`Total records: ${validationResult.totalRecords}`);
console.log(`Passed records: ${validationResult.passedRecords}`);
console.log(`Failed records: ${validationResult.failedRecords}`);
console.log(`Warning records: ${validationResult.warningRecords}`);
```

### 3. Generate Validation Report

```javascript
const validationService = new ValidationService();

const report = await validationService.generateValidationReport("run_123");

console.log(`Validation summary: ${JSON.stringify(report.summary)}`);
console.log(`Validation metrics: ${JSON.stringify(report.metrics)}`);

for (const result of report.details) {
  console.log(`Record ${result.recordId}: ${result.status}`);
  for (const fieldResult of result.fieldResults) {
    console.log(`  Field ${fieldResult.field}: ${fieldResult.status}`);
    if (fieldResult.errors.length > 0) {
      console.log(`    Errors: ${fieldResult.errors.join(", ")}`);
    }
    if (fieldResult.warnings.length > 0) {
      console.log(`    Warnings: ${fieldResult.warnings.join(", ")}`);
    }
  }
}
```

## Built-in Validation Rules

The framework provides a set of built-in validation rules for common validation scenarios:

### 1. Type Validation

- `required`: Ensures that a value is present
- `type`: Ensures that a value is of a specific type
- `nullable`: Ensures that a value can be null

### 2. String Validation

- `minLength`: Ensures that a string has a minimum length
- `maxLength`: Ensures that a string has a maximum length
- `pattern`: Ensures that a string matches a specific pattern
- `email`: Ensures that a string is a valid email address
- `url`: Ensures that a string is a valid URL
- `uuid`: Ensures that a string is a valid UUID

### 3. Number Validation

- `min`: Ensures that a number is greater than or equal to a minimum value
- `max`: Ensures that a number is less than or equal to a maximum value
- `positive`: Ensures that a number is positive
- `negative`: Ensures that a number is negative
- `integer`: Ensures that a number is an integer

### 4. Date Validation

- `minDate`: Ensures that a date is after a minimum date
- `maxDate`: Ensures that a date is before a maximum date
- `dateFormat`: Ensures that a date matches a specific format

### 5. Array Validation

- `minItems`: Ensures that an array has a minimum number of items
- `maxItems`: Ensures that an array has a maximum number of items
- `uniqueItems`: Ensures that an array has unique items

### 6. Object Validation

- `requiredFields`: Ensures that an object has specific fields
- `allowedFields`: Ensures that an object only has allowed fields

## Custom Validation Rules

The framework supports custom validation rules through a plugin architecture:

### 1. Rule Definition

Define a custom validation rule by implementing the `ValidationRule` interface:

```javascript
interface ValidationRule {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  validate(value: any, parameters: any): ValidationResult;
}
```

### 2. Rule Registration

Register the custom validation rule with the validation engine:

```javascript
validationEngine.registerRule(new CustomValidationRule());
```

### 3. Rule Usage

Use the custom validation rule in validation rule definitions:

```json
{
  "id": "rule_custom",
  "entity": "User",
  "field": "data",
  "type": "custom",
  "parameters": {
    "customParam1": "value1",
    "customParam2": "value2"
  },
  "message": "Custom validation failed",
  "severity": "error",
  "remediation": "reject"
}
```
