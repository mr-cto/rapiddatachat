### 5. Eliminate Table Existence Checks ✅

**Status: Completed**

- [x] Remove redundant table existence checks from `ProjectService` methods
- [x] Update error handling to properly handle missing tables
- [x] Implement schema validation at application startup
- [x] Use Prisma's built-in error handling for missing tables

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `lib/project/optimizedProjectService.ts` with Prisma ORM
- Eliminated redundant table existence checks
- Implemented proper error handling for missing tables
- Used Prisma's built-in error handling (PrismaClientKnownRequestError)

### 6. Optimize Schema Updates ✅

**Status: Completed**

- [x] Refactor `SchemaService.updateGlobalSchema` to use a single transaction
- [x] Implement differential updates for schema columns
- [x] Use batch operations for column creation
- [x] Add proper error handling and validation

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `lib/schema/schemaUpdateService.ts` with optimized schema updates
- Implemented transaction-based approach for atomic operations
- Added differential updates for schema columns (create/update/delete)
- Used batch operations for column creation
- Added proper error handling and validation

## Phase 3: Medium Priority Optimizations

### 7. Implement Caching Layer ✅

**Status: Completed**

- [x] Create multi-level caching system (memory-based)
- [x] Implement caching for schema and column mapping data
- [x] Add cache invalidation on data updates
- [x] Integrate caching with existing services

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `lib/cache/cacheManager.ts` with a robust caching system
- Implemented TTL-based cache invalidation with configurable timeouts
- Created `lib/schema/cachedSchemaService.ts` for cached schema operations
- Added cache key prefixes for efficient invalidation

### 8. Optimize Logging ✅

**Status: Completed**

- [x] Implement structured logging with log levels
- [x] Reduce excessive database operation logging
- [x] Add environment-based logging configuration
- [x] Ensure sensitive data is not logged

**Implementation Details:**

- Created `lib/logging/optimizedLogger.ts` with structured logging
- Implemented log batching and deduplication for better performance
- Added categorized logging with severity levels
- Integrated with caching system to prevent duplicate error logging

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

**Status: Not Started**

- [ ] Create performance test suite for database operations
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics before optimization
- [ ] Measure performance improvements after each phase
- [ ] Generate performance reports

## Phase 5: Deployment

**Status: Not Started**

- [ ] Deploy connection pooling changes to staging
- [ ] Validate in staging environment
- [ ] Deploy to production in phases
- [ ] Monitor performance and errors

## Phase 6: Prisma Accelerate Optimizations

### 9. Prisma Accelerate Integration ✅

**Status: Completed**

- [x] Created centralized Prisma Accelerate configuration
- [x] Implemented non-transactional fallbacks for large operations
- [x] Optimized batch processing for Accelerate environments
- [x] Added mini-batch processing for individual inserts

**Implementation Details:**
