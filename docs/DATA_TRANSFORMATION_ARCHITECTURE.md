## Implementation Approach

### Centralized vs. Decentralized

The architecture supports both centralized and decentralized approaches:

**Centralized:**

- Single transformation service handling all data types
- Consistent processing rules and validation
- Simplified management and monitoring
- Better resource utilization

**Decentralized:**

- Specialized transformation services for different data types
- Independent scaling based on data volume
- Optimized processing for specific data characteristics
- Improved fault isolation

The initial implementation will use a centralized approach for simplicity, with the architecture designed to support future decentralization if needed.

### Processing Models

The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing:

**Synchronous:**

- Immediate feedback on transformation results
- Simpler error handling
- Better for small to medium datasets
- Used for interactive user sessions

**Asynchronous:**

- Better performance for large datasets
- Support for batch processing
- Improved resource management
- Used for background processing of large files

### Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several ways:

- **Pluggable Transformations:** New transformation types can be added without modifying the core engine
- **Custom Validation Rules:** Domain-specific validation rules can be defined
