      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Create database schema for column merges",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema creation task into subtasks including: 1) Table creation with proper constraints, 2) Index creation for performance optimization, and 3) Writing unit tests to verify functionality",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves creating a single table with well-defined requirements. The schema is already provided with clear specifications for constraints and relationships. Database complexity metrics indicate that table creation with foreign key constraints adds some complexity but is still relatively straightforward."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement backend API for column merge operations",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API implementation into subtasks for each endpoint: 1) POST endpoint for creation, 2) GET endpoints for listing and retrieval, 3) PUT endpoint for updates, 4) DELETE endpoint for removal, and 5) Comprehensive test suite covering all endpoints",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it requires implementing 5 different API endpoints with validation logic, error handling, and database interactions. Each endpoint needs proper input validation and error handling, increasing the structural complexity of the software system."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create PostgreSQL VIEW generation functionality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the PostgreSQL VIEW generation functionality into: 1) Core view creation logic, 2) View update mechanism, 3) View deletion functionality, and 4) Comprehensive error handling and testing",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the dynamic SQL generation required and the need to handle various edge cases. The relational complexity metrics would be high as it involves creating database views with complex concatenation logic and proper error handling for various scenarios."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement UI for column merge selection",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI implementation into: 1) Column selection component with multi-select capability, 2) Configuration form for merge settings, 3) Validation logic for user inputs, and 4) Integration with existing UI framework",
      "reasoning": "This UI task has moderate complexity as it requires creating interactive components with state management and validation logic. The interface needs to handle multiple user interactions and provide appropriate feedback, increasing its structural complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement preview functionality for merged columns",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the preview functionality into: 1) Data fetching service for preview rows, 2) Merge logic implementation for preview generation, and 3) Dynamic update mechanism for real-time preview changes",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves fetching data and applying transformation logic. The core functionality is well-defined with a clear algorithm for merging columns, though it requires handling various data types and edge cases."

      "taskTitle": "Update prompt injection engine for merged columns",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the prompt injection engine update into: 1) Query mechanism for retrieving merged column configurations, 2) Schema enhancement logic to incorporate merged columns, and 3) Testing framework for verifying LLM understanding of merged columns",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it requires modifying an existing system (the LLM prompt injection engine) and ensuring proper integration. Understanding how merged columns should be represented to the LLM and testing this integration adds significant complexity."

      "taskId": 7,

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI-backend integration into: 1) API client implementation for CRUD operations, 2) State management for UI updates, 3) Error handling and user feedback mechanisms, and 4) Loading state management for asynchronous operations",
      "reasoning": "This integration task has moderate complexity as it connects previously implemented components. It requires handling asynchronous operations, error states, and ensuring the UI reflects the current state of the backend data."

      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to its comprehensive nature, covering both testing and documentation across the entire feature set. It requires understanding all components and their interactions, as well as creating clear documentation for different audiences."
